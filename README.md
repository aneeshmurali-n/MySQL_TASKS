# MySQL_TASKS
This repository contains SQL scripts for managing and querying a database. The database includes two main tables: departments and employees, and several SQL exercises to perform various operations on these tables. This project is designed for educational purposes to demonstrate basic SQL operations, including table creation, data insertion, querying, and creating stored procedures.
